    //we apply \n so as to make space b\w diff.variables 
    printf("the value of b is %f \n", b);//%f for real characters
    printf("the value of c is %c \n", c);//%c for characters
    printf("the sum of a and d is %d \n", a + d);// you can sum any two variables like this

}
/*now you can run the code 
best of luck*/
